An Open Source Client Onboarding Process
----------------------------------------

**Last Update: 14 October, 2018**


I developed this repository to accompany an article on ‘Building a Business’ that I was commissioned to write for Net magazine (Issue 312; October, 2018). I hope others find it useful.

This process represents the culmination of 25+ years of work as a [designer][01] working with both clients and agencies. It’s my methodology and, as such, it might not fit every situation, but I find it a useful approach to ensure that the projects I undertake are managed efficiently.

I use this structure to inform my teaching on Belfast School of Art’s BDes (Hons) Interaction Design programme, ensuring that my students are industry ready and have an understanding of the systems and processes typical studios use.

Although my process is structured with a number of phases, these phases often run concurrently and everything is developed iteratively.

I work very closely with the team at [Little Thunder][02], a boutique experience design company based in Belfast, so this process reflects the methodologies we share when we work together. (If you’re looking for a studio to work on a digital product, I’d recommend them in a heartbeat.)

Finally, I’m using this onboarding process as the backbone for a new book – provisionally titled ‘Designing Delightful Experiences’ – which focuses on the user experience design process from start to finish. The book is scheduled for release in early 2019. If that sounds interesting to you, [you might like to follow me on Twitter][03].

Phase 1: Benchmarking and Strategy
----------------------------------

After an initial client workshop, the first phase of my process is to undertake some benchmarking so that I can develop a strategy informed by considered research.

In this phase, which often involves defining a core brand message, I’ll undertake benchmarking, looking at competitors and defining the lay of the land.

With this research in hand, I’ll then develop a strategy: a bespoke approach that’s tailored to each individual project. I’ll also establish some goals so we can measure the validity of our assumptions.

The best design is at the service of clearly defined goals – it’s certainly not about surface look and feel (although that matters) – it’s about delivering on a clearly defined strategy: establishing 'measures of success' and then checking back against these, to see if the design is succeeding against those goals.


### Benchmarking

The projects I work on are more often than not confidential in nature, so I can’t share the assets I develop for them. However – in the spirit of ‘show, don’t tell’ – I think it’s useful to show examples from a project I **can** share.

<!-- This might be moved upfront? It seems like a bigger picture reference about the whole repository. -->

As the backbone of this repository I’m sharing the process I'm using as I develop the presence for my new business: [Mr Murphy Ltd.][01].

This project is just like any other, it takes a business (in this case, mine) and maps out the deliverables I’ve developed at every stage of the process.

I find it’s useful at the start of a project to establish benchmarks. For Mr Murphy Ltd., I undertook research into a variety of competitors, both individuals and businesses.

In my business I find it easiest to run workshops for clients, using Keynote as a tool to map everything out. I plan to include links to these keynotes here and will supply them when they’re finished.

/* I have a benchmarking and strategy deck, which I need to tidy. Although it’s a little awkward sharing my innermost thoughts and hopes, I think this would be useful for others to see, so I’ll share it when the slidedeck’s notes are cleaned up. Even at the risk of baring my soul! */


### Strategy

With research in hand, it’s time to define a strategy…

Usually if I’m working with a business they’ll have some goals in mind, something they’d like to achieve with the project. If they don’t have goals, I’ll work with them to establish some, otherwise, it’s very difficult to measure success.

In the case of Mr Murphy Ltd., it’s a company of one (more accurately two: Mr and Mrs Murphy), but this methodology can be applied to a business of any size.

I tie the strategy to a set of goals that allows us to test our assumptions. These goals – or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to use a technical term – allow me to measure success.

/* I’ll provide this deck shortly. Again, I'm baring my soul and I'm working on it. The bottom line – and you don't need to look at a slidedeck to see this – before you get in to how things look and feel (and sound), establish some goals, that will inform your strategy. */

Phase 2: Visual Grammar; Voice and Tone
---------------------------------------

With some benchmarking undertaken and an outline strategy established, the second phase of my process is to begin defining an overall aesthetic, both visual and verbal. I do this in two, related passes: considering the visual grammar (how everything looks); and the voice and tone (how everything sounds).


### Visual Grammar

My ‘Visual Grammar’ slidedeck explores a high-level design approach, pinpointing a ‘look and feel’ and an art direction for the project in hand. I use this slidedeck to brief the various designers on the project, so that they have a clear direction and are, importantly, all referring to a single source.

<img src="grammar.png" width="534">

A grammar is defined as a system of a language – a set of forms and a series of rules governing their usage – and my visual grammar deck is designed to tease out the building blocks of a design in a systematic manner.

This approach is similar to Dan Mall’s ‘Visual Inventory’ (which I was delighted to discover recently), but I’ve always named my deliverable ‘Visual Grammar’. Mall’s thoughts on this are well worth reading and he has, ever-helpfully, written [an article outlining his approach][04].

My visual grammar slidedeck is usually broken down into the following sections:

+ Information Architecture (IA)
+ Landing Pages
  + Overall Inspiration
  + Hero Images
  + Calls to Action
+ Typography
  + Overall Inspiration
  + Macro (At the page level.)
  + Micro (Focussing on the details.)
+ Branding
+ Imagery
+ Colour Palettes

This deck, of course, depends upon the clients’ specific needs and will vary according to the project’s scope and focus.

[Here’s the deck for my current redesign.](phase-2.1-visual-grammar.pdf) It’s designed to provide a clear direction for the site’s visual design. I used this deck to brief the team at Little Thunder on the look and feel. I'll be sharing their deliverables shortly, but you can also take a look at them at my [live redesign page][01].


### Voice and Tone

Every project – no matter how large or small – will benefit from some consideration of voice and tone.

Language, both verbal and visual, is an important part of what we shape as designers and it’s important to establish some benchmarks on the kind of voice and tone that will be used.

After undertaking some research, which will include a content audit, I’ll develop a ‘brand dictionary’ for every project. This ensures that the language that underpins the design is considered holistically.

Phase 3: Content Design and Copywriting
---------------------------------------

It’s almost impossible to design without content. What we design and build as designers involves content of one form or another, as such it’s important to proactively design content as an integral part of our process.

Using placeholder copy, like lorem ipsum, is – in my (strongly held) opinion pointless. I’ll not dwell on the point, as [I’ve written about it before][LI], suffice to say: content matters.

Words – and other forms of content – are an essential part of the design process, indeed words, when written well, can be the design itself. I’ve written two short books on the subject, for Five Simple Steps, which are still [available][CW].

Well-written and well-crafted content can capture the attention of the reader, allowing words to speak. Equally, other forms of content, like images or video, also play a role in design.


### Content Design

Everything we shape as designers is content of one form or another. Without content, we wouldn’t have much to design. Content is often left until the end of the process, in the expectation that the client will deliver it, ready packaged and all set to go.

In my experience, clients rarely deliver the content on time, so I find it helpful to take a proactive role in developing content and **designing it**. Sarah Richards – who led GOV.UK’s Content Design team – has written the definitive book on content design. Every designer should own a copy and I strongly recommend reading it.
